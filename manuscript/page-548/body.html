Huck, I don&apos;t feel comfortable a bit.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Say, Tom, let&apos;s give this place up, and try somewheres else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, I reckon we better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&apos;ll it be?&quot;</p><p>Tom considered awhile; and then said:</p><p>&quot;The ha&apos;nted house. That&apos;s it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Blame it, I don&apos;t like ha&apos;nted houses, Tom. Why, they&apos;re a dern sight worse&apos;n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don&apos;t come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain&apos;t noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn&apos;t stand such a thing as that, Tom&#x2014;nobody could.&quot;</p></div> </div>
