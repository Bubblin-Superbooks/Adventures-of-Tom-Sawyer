<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well, he&apos;s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get him out of there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;My! we couldn&apos;t get him out, Tom. And besides, &apos;twouldn&apos;t do any good; they&apos;d ketch him again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes&#x2014;so they would. But I hate to hear &apos;em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done&#x2014;that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear &apos;em say he&apos;s the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn&apos;t ever hung before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I&apos;ve heard &apos;em say that if he was to get free they&apos;d lynch him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And they&apos;d do it, too.&quot;</p></div> </div>
