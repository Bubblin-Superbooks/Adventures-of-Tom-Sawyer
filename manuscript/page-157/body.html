<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Aunt Polly, it <i>seemed</i> mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your tooth, indeed! What&apos;s the matter with your tooth?&quot;</p><p>&quot;One of them&apos;s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There, there, now, don&apos;t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well&#x2014;your tooth <i>is</i> loose, but you&apos;re not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.&quot;</p><p>Tom said:</p><p>&quot;Oh, please, auntie, don&apos;t pull it out. It don&apos;t hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don&apos;t, auntie. I don&apos;t want to stay home from school.&quot;</p></div> </div>
