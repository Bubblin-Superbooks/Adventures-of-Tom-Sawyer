<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect&apos;s need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. </p><p> It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal&apos;s cave. Injun Joe&apos;s cup stands first in the list of the cavern&apos;s marvels; even &quot;Aladdin&apos;s Palace&quot; cannot rival it. </p></div> </div>
