<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill <i>him</i> if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don&apos;t kill her&#x2014;bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils&#x2014;you notch her ears like a sow!&quot;</p><p>&quot;By God, that&apos;s&#x2014;&quot;</p><p> &quot;Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I&apos;ll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I&apos;ll not cry, if she does. My friend, you&apos;ll help me in this thing&#x2014;for my sake&#x2014;that&apos;s why you&apos;re here&#x2014;I mightn&apos;t be able alone. </p><p>&quot;Well, if it&apos;s got to be done, let&apos;s get at it. The quicker the better&#x2014;I&apos;m all in a shiver.&quot;</p></div> </div>
