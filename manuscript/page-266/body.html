<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter&#x2014;so the story ran. And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the &quot;branch&quot; about one or two o&apos;clock in the morning, and that Potter had at once sneaked off&#x2014;suspicious circumstances, especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. </p><p> It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this &quot;murderer&quot; (the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff &quot;was confident&quot; that he would be captured before night. </p></div> </div>
