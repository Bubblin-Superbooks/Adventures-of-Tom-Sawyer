<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come back! No&#x2014;I can&apos;t find the way. It&apos;s all mixed up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tom, Tom, we&apos;re lost! we&apos;re lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, why <i>did</i> we ever leave the others!&quot;</p><p> She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. </p></div> </div>
