Two thousand verses is a great many&#x2014;very, very great many. And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it&apos;s what makes great men and good men; you&apos;ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you&apos;ll look back and say, It&apos;s all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood&#x2014;it&apos;s all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn&#x2014;it&apos;s all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible&#x2014;a splendid elegant Bible&#x2014;to keep and have it all for my own, always&#x2014;it&apos;s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas&#x2014;and you wouldn&apos;t take any money for those two thousand verses&#x2014;no indeed you wouldn&apos;t. </p></div> </div>
