<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Why, is it hid all around?"</p><p>"No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck—sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses."</p><p>"Who hides it?"</p><p>"Why, robbers, of course—who'd you reckon? Sunday-school sup'rintendents?"</p><p>"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have a good time."</p><p>"So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and leave it there."</p></div> </div>
