After a long and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:</p><p>&quot;Look here, lad&#x2014;you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there till you hear from me. I&apos;ll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for a look. We&apos;ll do that &apos;dangerous&apos; job after I&apos;ve spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We&apos;ll leg it together!&quot;</p><p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said:</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m dead for sleep! It&apos;s your turn to watch.&quot;</p><p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.</p></div> </div>
