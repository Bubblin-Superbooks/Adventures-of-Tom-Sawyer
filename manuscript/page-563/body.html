<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. </p><p>"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't hender us from digging there in the daytime."</p><p>"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night."</p><p>"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered, anyway—but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts."</p></div> </div>
