<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. </p><p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p><p>&quot;Hello, Huckleberry!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hello yourself, and see how you like it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&apos;s that you got?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dead cat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lemme see him, Huck. My, he&apos;s pretty stiff. Where&apos;d you get him?&quot;</p></div> </div>
