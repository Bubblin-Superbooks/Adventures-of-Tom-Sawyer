If there&apos;d been three, he&apos;d be drunk enough and I&apos;d do it.&quot;</p><p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p><p>&quot;Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe&apos;s not in there. It&apos;s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we&apos;ll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we&apos;ll snatch that box quicker&apos;n lightning.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m agreed. I&apos;ll watch the whole night long, and I&apos;ll do it every night, too, if you&apos;ll do the other part of the job.&quot;</p></div> </div>
