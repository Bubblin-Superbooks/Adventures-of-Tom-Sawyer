After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. </p><p>Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence.

If I&apos;d a knowed this was all, I&apos;d a learnt long ago.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So would I,&quot; said Joe. &quot;It&apos;s just nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, many a time I&apos;ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,&quot; said Tom.</p></div> </div>
