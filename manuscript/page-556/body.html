<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain&apos;t all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night&#x2014;dreampt about rats.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s good, Huck. When they don&apos;t fight it&apos;s only a sign that there&apos;s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We&apos;ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Who&apos;s Robin Hood?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England&#x2014;and the best. He was a robber.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved &apos;em. He always divided up with &apos;em perfectly square.&quot;</p></div> </div>
