<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. </p><p>"I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I liveâ€”please make up, won't you?"</p><p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:</p><p>"I'll thank you to keep yourself to yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll never speak to you again."</p><p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss Smarty?" until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. </p></div> </div>
