The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:</p><p>&quot;<i>That</i> score is settled&#x2014;damn you.&quot;</p><p> Then he robbed the body.

His hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. </p><p>&quot;Lord, how is this, Joe?&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a dirty business,&quot; said Joe, without moving.</p><p>&quot;What did you do it for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I! I never done it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look here! That kind of talk won&apos;t wash.&quot;</p><p>Potter trembled and grew white.</p></div> </div>
