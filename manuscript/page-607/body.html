So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night&apos;s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. </p><p> Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas&apos;. And why should he give it up, he reasoned&#x2014;the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day. </p></div> </div>
