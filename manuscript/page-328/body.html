A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, &quot;Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children&apos;s alone,&quot; and she took wing and went off to see about it&#x2014;which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. </p></div> </div>
