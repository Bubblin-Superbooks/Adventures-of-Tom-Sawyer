<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use&#x2014;&apos;twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, &apos;Fire boys!&apos; and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. </p><p> So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn&apos;t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. </p></div> </div>
