<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;In Ben Rogers&apos; hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap&apos;s nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That&apos;s a mighty good nigger, Tom. </p><p> He likes me, becuz I don&apos;t ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I&apos;ve set right down and eat with him. But you needn&apos;t tell that. A body&apos;s got to do things when he&apos;s awful hungry he wouldn&apos;t want to do as a steady thing.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Well, if I don&apos;t want you in the daytime, I&apos;ll let you sleep. I won&apos;t come bothering around. Any time you see something&apos;s up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.&quot;</p></div> </div>
