<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet."<p>CONCLUSION</p><p>SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a boy, it must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stopâ€”that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can. </p><p>Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are prosperous and happy.</p></div> </div>
