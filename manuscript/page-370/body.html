How&apos;d you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver&#x2014;hey?&quot;</p><p>But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.

Finally he said:</p><p>&quot;Oh, boys, let&apos;s give it up. I want to go home. It&apos;s so lonesome.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh no, Joe, you&apos;ll feel better by and by,&quot; said Tom. &quot;Just think of the fishing that&apos;s here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t care for fishing. I want to go home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, Joe, there ain&apos;t such another swimming-place anywhere.&quot;</p></div> </div>
