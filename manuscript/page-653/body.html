<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names &quot;BECKY &amp; TOM&quot; had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. </p><p> Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle&#x2014;and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher&apos;s light. </p></div> </div>
