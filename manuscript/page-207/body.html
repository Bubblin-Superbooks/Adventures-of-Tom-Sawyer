I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back."</p><p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.</p><p>"Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill you.
