He heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf&#x2014;and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business. </p><p> The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o&apos;clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. Eleven o&apos;clock came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. </p></div> </div>
