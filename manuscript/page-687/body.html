I believe it's better'n to be a pirate."</p><p>"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that."</p><p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the lead.

A few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. </p><p>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the "jumping-off place." The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high. </p></div> </div>
