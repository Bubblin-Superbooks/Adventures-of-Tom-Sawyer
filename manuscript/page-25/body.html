<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Hang the boy, can&apos;t I never learn anything? Ain&apos;t he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can&apos;t learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what&apos;s coming? He &apos;pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it&apos;s all down again and I can&apos;t hit him a lick. </p></div> </div>
