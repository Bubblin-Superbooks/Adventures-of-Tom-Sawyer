"My, but we're rich, Tom!"</p><p>"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we have got it, sure! Sayâ€”let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box."</p><p>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.</p></div> </div>
