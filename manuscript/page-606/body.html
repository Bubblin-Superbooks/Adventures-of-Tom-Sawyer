She&apos;ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day&#x2014;dead loads of it. And she&apos;ll be awful glad to have us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that will be fun!&quot;</p><p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p><p>&quot;But what will mamma say?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How&apos;ll she ever know?&quot;</p><p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:</p><p>&quot;I reckon it&apos;s wrong&#x2014;but&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;But shucks! Your mother won&apos;t know, and so what&apos;s the harm? All she wants is that you&apos;ll be safe; and I bet you she&apos;d &apos;a&apos; said go there if she&apos;d &apos;a&apos; thought of it. I know she would!&quot;</p></div> </div>
