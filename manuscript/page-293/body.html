<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat <i>might</i> be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom&apos;s head and said gently:</p><p>&quot;I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it <i>did</i> do you good.&quot;</p><p>Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.</p><p>&quot;I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done <i>him</i> good, too. I never see him get around so since&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, go &apos;long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can&apos;t be a good boy, for once, and you needn&apos;t take any more medicine.&quot;</p></div> </div>
