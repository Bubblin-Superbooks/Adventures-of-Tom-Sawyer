<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn&apos;t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar&#x2014;but no dog&#x2014;the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash. </p><p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while&#x2014;plenty of company&#x2014;and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn&apos;t run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.</p></div> </div>
