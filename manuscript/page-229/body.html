I don&apos;t believe they&apos;ll bother us. We ain&apos;t doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won&apos;t notice us at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I&apos;m all of a shiver.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Listen!&quot;</p><p>The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.</p><p>&quot;Look! See there!&quot; whispered Tom. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.&quot;</p><p>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s the devils sure enough. Three of &apos;em! Lordy, Tom, we&apos;re goners! Can you pray?&quot;</p></div> </div>
