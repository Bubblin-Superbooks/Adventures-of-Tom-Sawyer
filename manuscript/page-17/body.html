<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual&#x2014;he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.</p><p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story&#x2014;that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.</p></div> </div>
