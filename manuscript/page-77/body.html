He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. </p><p> He had been months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done. </p><p>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. </p></div> </div>
