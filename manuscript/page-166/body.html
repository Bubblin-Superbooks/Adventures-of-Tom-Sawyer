I&apos;ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I&apos;ve always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take &apos;em off with a bean.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, bean&apos;s good. I&apos;ve done that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have you? What&apos;s your way?&quot;</p><p> &quot;You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it &apos;bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. </p></div> </div>
