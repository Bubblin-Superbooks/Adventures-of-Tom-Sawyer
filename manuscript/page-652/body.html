As they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:</p><p>"Oh, please don't tell anybody it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please!"</p><p>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did."</p><p>"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"</p><p>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:</p><p>"They won't tell—and I won't.
