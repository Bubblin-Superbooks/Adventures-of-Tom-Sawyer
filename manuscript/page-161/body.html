I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night."</p><p>"But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?"</p><p>"Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and then it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't reckon."</p><p>"I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?"</p><p>"Of course—if you ain't afeard."</p><p>"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"</p><p>"Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window—but don't you tell."</p></div> </div>
