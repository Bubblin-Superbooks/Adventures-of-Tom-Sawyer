She went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom&apos;s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:</p><p>&quot;Well, I never! There&apos;s no getting round it, you can work when you&apos;re a mind to, Tom.&quot; And then she diluted the compliment by adding, &quot;But it&apos;s powerful seldom you&apos;re a mind to, I&apos;m bound to say. Well, go &apos;long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I&apos;ll tan you.&quot;</p></div> </div>
