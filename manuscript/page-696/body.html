<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> When the boys reached the Welshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:<p>"Hallo, who's that?"</p><p>"Huck and Tom Sawyer."</p><p>"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?"</p><p>"Old metal," said Tom.</p><p>"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature—hurry along, hurry along!"</p></div> </div>
