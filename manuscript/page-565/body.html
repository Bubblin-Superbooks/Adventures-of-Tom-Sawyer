What&apos;ll we do with what little swag we&apos;ve got left?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know&#x2014;leave it here as we&apos;ve always done, I reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver&apos;s something to carry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well&#x2014;all right&#x2014;it won&apos;t matter to come here once more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No&#x2014;but I&apos;d say come in the night as we used to do&#x2014;it&apos;s better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; &apos;tain&apos;t in such a very good place; we&apos;ll just regularly bury it&#x2014;and bury it deep.&quot;</p></div> </div>
