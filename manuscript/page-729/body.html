<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This funeral stopped the further growth of one thingâ€”the petition to the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. </p><p> Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works. </p><p>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk.</p></div> </div>
