<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this."</p><p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little foolish, and he said:</p><p>"Aunt Polly, it seemed mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all."</p><p>"Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?"</p><p>"One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful."</p><p>"There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Wellâ€”your tooth is loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen."</p><p>Tom said:</p><p>"Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home from school."</p></div> </div>
