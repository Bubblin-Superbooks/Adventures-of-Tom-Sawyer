My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals&#x2014;&apos;twould help a good deal. </p><p>&quot;Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Splendid! Describe them&#x2014;describe them, my boy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;One&apos;s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that&apos;s ben around here once or twice, and t&apos;other&apos;s a mean-looking, ragged&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s enough, lad, we know the men!
