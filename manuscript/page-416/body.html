<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he&apos;d do if he was awake. Here&apos;s a big Milum apple I&apos;ve been saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found again&#x2014;now go &apos;long to school. I&apos;m thankful to the good God and Father of us all I&apos;ve got you back, that&apos;s long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I&apos;m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there&apos;s few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. </p></div> </div>
