<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Now you&apos;re <i>talking</i>! Don&apos;t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won&apos;t.&quot;</p><p> THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. </p><p> The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and &quot;maow,&quot; whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve. </p></div> </div>
