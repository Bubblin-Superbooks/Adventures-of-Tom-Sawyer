Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doomâ€”a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. </p><p>And now the minister prayed.
