<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Now, that&apos;s something <i>like</i>! Why, it&apos;s a million times bullier than pirating. I&apos;ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg&apos;lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking &apos;bout it, I reckon she&apos;ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.&quot;</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a <i>boy</i>, it must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a <i>man</i>. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stop&#x2014;that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.</p></div> </div>
