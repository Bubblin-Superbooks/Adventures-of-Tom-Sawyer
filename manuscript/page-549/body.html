<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don&apos;t travel around only at night. They won&apos;t hender us from digging there in the daytime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s so. But you know mighty well people don&apos;t go about that ha&apos;nted house in the day nor the night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s mostly because they don&apos;t like to go where a man&apos;s been murdered, anyway&#x2014;but nothing&apos;s ever been seen around that house except in the night&#x2014;just some blue lights slipping by the windows&#x2014;no regular ghosts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there&apos;s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don&apos;t anybody but ghosts use &apos;em.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s so. But anyway they don&apos;t come around in the daytime, so what&apos;s the use of our being afeard?&quot;</p></div> </div>
