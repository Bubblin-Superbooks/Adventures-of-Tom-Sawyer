<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. </p><p>"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate."</p><p>"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all that."</p><p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the lead.
