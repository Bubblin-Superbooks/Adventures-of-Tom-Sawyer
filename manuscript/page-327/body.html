<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and &quot;sniffing around,&quot; then proceeding again&#x2014;for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom&apos;s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad&#x2014;for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes&#x2014;without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. </p></div> </div>
