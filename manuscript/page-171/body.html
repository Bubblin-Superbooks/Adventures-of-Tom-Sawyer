<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I won&apos;t. I couldn&apos;t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I&apos;ll meow this time. Say&#x2014;what&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing but a tick.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where&apos;d you get him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Out in the woods.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&apos;ll you take for him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t want to sell him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right. It&apos;s a mighty small tick, anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don&apos;t belong to them. I&apos;m satisfied with it. It&apos;s a good enough tick for me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sho, there&apos;s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of &apos;em if I wanted to.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, why don&apos;t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can&apos;t. This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It&apos;s the first one I&apos;ve seen this year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Say, Huck&#x2014;I&apos;ll give you my tooth for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Less see it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
