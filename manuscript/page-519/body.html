Let's hide the tools in the bushes."</p><p>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. </p><p> The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked little.

Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. </p></div> </div>
