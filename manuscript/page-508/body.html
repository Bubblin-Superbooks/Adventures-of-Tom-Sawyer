<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics." <p>"Hyro—which?"</p><p>"Hy'roglyphics—pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean anything."</p><p>"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Well then, how you going to find the marks?"</p><p>"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch, and there's lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of 'em." </p></div> </div>
