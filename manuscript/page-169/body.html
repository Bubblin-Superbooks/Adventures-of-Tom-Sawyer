D&apos;you ever try it, Huck?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I reckon it&apos;s so, then. Becuz they say she&apos;s a witch.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Say! Why, Tom, I <i>know</i> she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn&apos;t dodged, he&apos;d a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off&apos;n a shed wher&apos; he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, that&apos;s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they&apos;re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they&apos;re saying the Lord&apos;s Prayer backards.&quot;</p></div> </div>
