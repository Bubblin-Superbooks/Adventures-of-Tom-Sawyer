<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted, &quot;Turn out! turn out! they&apos;re found! they&apos;re found!&quot; Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah!. </p><p>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher&apos;s house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher&apos;s hand, tried to speak but couldn&apos;t&#x2014;and drifted out raining tears all over the place.</p></div> </div>
