<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"> I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you remember? You won't tell, will you, Joe?" And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands. <p>"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say."</p><p>"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I live." And Potter began to cry.</p><p>"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any tracks behind you."</p></div> </div>
