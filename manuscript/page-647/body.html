<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:</p><p>"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"</p><p>"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!â€”and welcome!"</p><p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. </p></div> </div>
