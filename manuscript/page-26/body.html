<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I ain&apos;t doing my duty by that boy, and that&apos;s the Lord&apos;s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I&apos;m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He&apos;s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he&apos;s my own dead sister&apos;s boy, poor thing, and I ain&apos;t got the heart to lash him, somehow. </p><p> Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it&apos;s so. He&apos;ll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for &quot;afternoon&quot;] I&apos;ll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. </p></div> </div>
