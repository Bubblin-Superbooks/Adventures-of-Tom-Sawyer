<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Oh, I didn&apos;t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I&apos;ve fought, but never with weepons. They&apos;ll all say that. </p><p> Joe, don&apos;t tell! Say you won&apos;t tell, Joe&#x2014;that&apos;s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don&apos;t you remember? You won&apos;t tell, will you, Joe?&quot; And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands. </p><p>&quot;No, you&apos;ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won&apos;t go back on you. There, now, that&apos;s as fair as a man can say.&quot;</p></div> </div>
