<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Number Two&#x2014;yes, that&apos;s it. I been thinking &apos;bout that. But I can&apos;t make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I dono. It&apos;s too deep. Say, Huck&#x2014;maybe it&apos;s the number of a house!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Goody!... No, Tom, that ain&apos;t it. If it is, it ain&apos;t in this one-horse town. They ain&apos;t no numbers here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s so. Lemme think a minute. Here&#x2014;it&apos;s the number of a room&#x2014;in a tavern, you know!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s the trick! They ain&apos;t only two taverns. We can find out quick.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You stay here, Huck, till I come.&quot;</p></div> </div>
