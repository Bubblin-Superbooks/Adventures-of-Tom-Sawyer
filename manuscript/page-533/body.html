<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;No, indeed it ain&apos;t. It&apos;s hid in mighty particular places, Huck&#x2014;sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha&apos;nted houses.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who hides it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, robbers, of course&#x2014;who&apos;d you reckon? Sunday-school sup&apos;rintendents?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. If &apos;twas mine I wouldn&apos;t hide it; I&apos;d spend it and have a good time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So would I. But robbers don&apos;t do that way. They always hide it and leave it there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t they come after it any more?&quot;</p></div> </div>
