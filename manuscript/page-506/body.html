<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Talk? Well, it&apos;s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so&apos;s I want to hide som&apos;ers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he&apos;s a goner. Don&apos;t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Most always&#x2014;most always. He ain&apos;t no account; but then he hain&apos;t ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on&#x2014;and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that&#x2014;leastways most of us&#x2014;preachers and such like. But he&apos;s kind of good&#x2014;he give me half a fish, once, when there warn&apos;t enough for two; and lots of times he&apos;s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.&quot; </p></div> </div>
