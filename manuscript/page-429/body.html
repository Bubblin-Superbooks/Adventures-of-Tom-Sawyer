She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure, stark naked. <p> At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. </p><p>"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and look at what they're looking at."</p><p>"How could I know you was looking at anything?"</p><p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school."</p></div> </div>
