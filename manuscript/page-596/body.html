He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&apos;d never &apos;a&apos; thought of the towel, I bet!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Say, Tom, did you see that box?&quot;</p></div> </div>
