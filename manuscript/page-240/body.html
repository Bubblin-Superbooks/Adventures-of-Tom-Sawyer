I&apos;ll bless you for this the longest day I live.&quot; And Potter began to cry.</p><p>&quot;Come, now, that&apos;s enough of that. This ain&apos;t any time for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I&apos;ll go this. Move, now, and don&apos;t leave any tracks behind you.&quot;</p><p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:</p><p>&quot;If he&apos;s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being, he won&apos;t think of the knife till he&apos;s gone so far he&apos;ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself&#x2014;chicken-heart!&quot;</p></div> </div>
