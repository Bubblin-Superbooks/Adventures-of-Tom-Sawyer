Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass.

He handed in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again. </p><p>The funeral was a fine thing.
