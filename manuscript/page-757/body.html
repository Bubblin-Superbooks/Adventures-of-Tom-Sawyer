<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;Don&apos;t talk about it, Tom. I&apos;ve tried it, and it don&apos;t work; it don&apos;t work, Tom. It ain&apos;t for me; I ain&apos;t used to it. The widder&apos;s good to me, and friendly; but I can&apos;t stand them ways. She makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won&apos;t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don&apos;t seem to any air git through &apos;em, somehow; and they&apos;re so rotten nice that I can&apos;t set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher&apos;s; I hain&apos;t slid on a cellar-door for&#x2014;well, it &apos;pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat&#x2014;I hate them ornery sermons! I can&apos;t ketch a fly in there, I can&apos;t chaw. </p></div> </div>
