His whisper was hardly audible when he said:</p><p>&quot;Oh, Huck, <i>its a stray dog</i>!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huck, he must mean us both&#x2014;we&apos;re right together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, Tom, I reckon we&apos;re goners. I reckon there ain&apos;t no mistake &apos;bout where <i>I&apos;ll</i> go to. I been so wicked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller&apos;s told <i>not</i> to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I&apos;d a tried&#x2014;but no, I wouldn&apos;t, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I&apos;ll just <i>waller</i> in Sunday-schools!&quot; And Tom began to snuffle a little.</p></div> </div>
