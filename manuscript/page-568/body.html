He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out."</p><p>"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"</p><p>"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!"</p><p>"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"</p><p>"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it."</p><p>"Say, Tom, did you see that box?"</p><p>"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. </p></div> </div>
