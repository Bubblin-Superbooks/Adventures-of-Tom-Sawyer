Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, &apos;long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when <i>he</i> snores. Besides, I reckon he ain&apos;t ever coming back to this town any more.&quot;</p><p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys&apos; souls once more.</p><p>&quot;Hucky, do you das&apos;t to go if I lead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t like to, much. Tom, s&apos;pose it&apos;s Injun Joe!&quot;</p><p> Tom quailed.

So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. </p></div> </div>
