<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s it, Huck&#x2014;that&apos;s it; though when you&apos;re burying it if you say &apos;Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!&apos; it&apos;s better. That&apos;s the way Joe Harper does, and he&apos;s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say&#x2014;how do you cure &apos;em with dead cats?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard &apos;long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it&apos;s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can&apos;t see &apos;em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear &apos;em talk; and when they&apos;re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after &apos;em and say, &apos;Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I&apos;m done with ye!&apos; That&apos;ll fetch any wart.&quot; </p></div> </div>
