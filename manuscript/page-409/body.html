That&apos;s something, ain&apos;t it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It ain&apos;t much&#x2014;a cat does that much&#x2014;but it&apos;s better than nothing. What did you dream?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, so we did. So we always do. I&apos;m glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I dreamt that Joe Harper&apos;s mother was here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, lots. But it&apos;s so dim, now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, try to recollect&#x2014;can&apos;t you?&quot;</p></div> </div>
