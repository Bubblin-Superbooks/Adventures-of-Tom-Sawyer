They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the caveâ€”wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room," "The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. </p><p> Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). </p><p> Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed.</p></div> </div>
