<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Huck&apos;s scared voice answered in a low tone:</p><p>&quot;Please let me in! It&apos;s only Huck Finn!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!&#x2014;and welcome!&quot;</p><p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy&apos;s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.</p><p>&quot;Now, my boy, I hope you&apos;re good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun&apos;s up, and we&apos;ll have a piping hot one, too&#x2014;make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you&apos;d turn up and stop here last night.&quot;</p></div> </div>
