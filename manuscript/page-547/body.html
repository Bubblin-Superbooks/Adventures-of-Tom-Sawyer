We can&apos;t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing&apos;s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something&apos;s behind me all the time; and I&apos;m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there&apos;s others in front a-waiting for a chance. </p><p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Lordy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, they do. I&apos;ve always heard that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tom, I don&apos;t like to fool around much where there&apos;s dead people. A body&apos;s bound to get into trouble with &apos;em, sure.&quot;</p></div> </div>
