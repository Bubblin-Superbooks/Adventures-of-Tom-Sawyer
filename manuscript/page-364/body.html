He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom&apos;s too proud for that sort of thing. He&apos;s up to something or other.

The writing says they are if he ain&apos;t back here to breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which he is!&quot; exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly into camp.</p><p>A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.
