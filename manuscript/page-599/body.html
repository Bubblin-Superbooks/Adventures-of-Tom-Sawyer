All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow&#x2014;and if I&apos;m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that&apos;ll fetch me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Agreed, and good as wheat!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now, Huck, the storm&apos;s over, and I&apos;ll go home. It&apos;ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I said I would, Tom, and I will. I&apos;ll ha&apos;nt that tavern every night for a year! I&apos;ll sleep all day and I&apos;ll stand watch all night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?&quot;</p></div> </div>
