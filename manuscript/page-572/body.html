He was a robber."</p><p>"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"</p><p>"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em perfectly square."</p><p>"Well, he must 'a' been a brick."</p><p>"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half."</p></div> </div>
