<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news&#x2014;Judge Thatcher&apos;s family had come back to town the night before. Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy&apos;s interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing &quot;hispy&quot; and &quot;gully-keeper&quot; with a crowd of their schoolmates. </p><p> The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. The child&apos;s delight was boundless; and Tom&apos;s not more moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. </p></div> </div>
