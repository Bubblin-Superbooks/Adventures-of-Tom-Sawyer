<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. </p><p> They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, &quot;Hist!&quot; every now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if &quot;the foe&quot; stirred, to &quot;let him have it to the hilt,&quot; because &quot;dead men tell no tales.&quot; They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way. </p></div> </div>
