<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To-night. I reckon they&apos;ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But they buried him Saturday. Didn&apos;t they get him Saturday night?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?&#x2014;and <i>then</i> it&apos;s Sunday. Devils don&apos;t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don&apos;t reckon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I never thought of that. That&apos;s so. Lemme go with you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course&#x2014;if you ain&apos;t afeard.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Afeard! &apos;Tain&apos;t likely. Will you meow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes&#x2014;and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep&apos; me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says &apos;Dern that cat!&apos; and so I hove a brick through his window&#x2014;but don&apos;t you tell.&quot;</p></div> </div>
