<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &quot;My boy, don&apos;t be afraid of me. I wouldn&apos;t hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No&#x2014;I&apos;d protect you&#x2014;I&apos;d protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you&apos;ve let that slip without intending it; you can&apos;t cover that up now. </p><p>Huck looked into the old man&apos;s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:</p><p>&quot;&apos;Tain&apos;t a Spaniard&#x2014;it&apos;s Injun Joe!&quot;</p><p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don&apos;t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That&apos;s a different matter altogether.&quot;</p></div> </div>
