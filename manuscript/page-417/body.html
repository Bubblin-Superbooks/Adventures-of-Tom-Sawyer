It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said:</p><p>"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done itâ€”but I didn't think."</p><p>"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow." </p></div> </div>
