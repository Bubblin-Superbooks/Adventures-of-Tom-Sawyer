<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Injun Joe&apos;s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. </p><p> But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something&#x2014;in order to pass the weary time&#x2014;in order to employ his tortured faculties. </p></div> </div>
