        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a boy, it must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stopâ€”that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can. </p>
