It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. </p><p> Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice said: </p><p>"Who goes there?"</p><p>"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names."</p><p>"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas." Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.</p><p>"'Tis well. Give the countersign."</p></div> </div>
