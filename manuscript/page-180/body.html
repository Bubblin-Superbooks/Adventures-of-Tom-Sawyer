Tom said:</p><p>&quot;Oh, it ain&apos;t anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes it is.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No it ain&apos;t. You don&apos;t want to see.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&apos;ll tell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No I won&apos;t&#x2014;deed and deed and double deed won&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You won&apos;t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t ever tell <i>any</i>body. Now let me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, <i>you</i> don&apos;t want to see!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now that you treat me so, I <i>will</i> see.&quot; And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: &quot;<i>I love you</i>.&quot;</p></div> </div>
