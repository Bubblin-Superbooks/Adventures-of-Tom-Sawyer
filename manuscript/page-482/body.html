But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done—that."</p><p>"I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before."</p><p>"Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he was to get free they'd lynch him."</p><p>"And they'd do it, too."</p></div> </div>
