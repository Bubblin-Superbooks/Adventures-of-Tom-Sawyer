<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:</p><p>&quot;Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!&quot;</p><p> They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the &quot;point&quot; he was driving at, and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was &quot;splendid!&quot; and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn&apos;t have started away. </p></div> </div>
