<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I was awful scared,&quot; said Huck, &quot;and I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn&apos;t stop for three mile. I&apos;ve come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn&apos;t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Well, poor chap, you do look as if you&apos;d had a hard night of it&#x2014;but there&apos;s a bed here for you when you&apos;ve had your breakfast. No, they ain&apos;t dead, lad&#x2014;we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them&#x2014;dark as a cellar that sumach path was&#x2014;and just then I found I was going to sneeze. </p></div> </div>
