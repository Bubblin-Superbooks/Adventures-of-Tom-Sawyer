<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting&#x2014;for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. </p><p>&quot;What, a&apos;ready? How much have you done?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s all done, aunt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tom, don&apos;t lie to me&#x2014;I can&apos;t bear it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I ain&apos;t, aunt; it <i>is</i> all done.&quot;</p></div> </div>
