<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson&apos;s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn&apos;t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn&apos;t mean to be mean. I didn&apos;t, honest. And besides, I didn&apos;t come over here to laugh at you that night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did you come for, then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn&apos;t got drownded.&quot;</p></div> </div>
