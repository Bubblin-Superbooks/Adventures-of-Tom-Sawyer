<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered "what had got into the child." He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:</p><p>"Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it."</p><p>"Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into that sugar if I warn't watching you."</p><p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowlâ€”a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. </p></div> </div>
