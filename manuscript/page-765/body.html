<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;It&apos;s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang&apos;s secrets, even if you&apos;re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s gay&#x2014;that&apos;s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing&apos;s got to be done at midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find&#x2014;a ha&apos;nted house is the best, but they&apos;re all ripped up now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, midnight&apos;s good, anyway, Tom.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, so it is. And you&apos;ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with blood.&quot;</p></div> </div>
