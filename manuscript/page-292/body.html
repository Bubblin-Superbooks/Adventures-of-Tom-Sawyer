<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by anxiety. Too late he divined her &quot;drift.&quot; The handle of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle&#x2014;his ear&#x2014;and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.</p><p>&quot;Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I done it out of pity for him&#x2014;because he hadn&apos;t any aunt.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hadn&apos;t any aunt!&#x2014;you numskull. What has that got to do with it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Heaps. Because if he&apos;d had one she&apos;d a burnt him out herself! She&apos;d a roasted his bowels out of him &apos;thout any more feeling than if he was a human!&quot;</p></div> </div>
