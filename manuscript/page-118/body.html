<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The young lady teachers &quot;showed off&quot;&#x2014;bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers &quot;showed off&quot; with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline&#x2014;and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). </p><p> The little girls &quot;showed off&quot; in various ways, and the little boys &quot;showed off&quot; with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur&#x2014;for he was &quot;showing off,&quot; too. </p></div> </div>
