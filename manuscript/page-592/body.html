Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt&apos;s old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Huck&apos;s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. </p><p> Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
