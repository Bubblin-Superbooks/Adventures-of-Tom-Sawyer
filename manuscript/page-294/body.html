<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking&#x2014;down the road. </p><p> Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom&apos;s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and &quot;led up&quot; warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. </p></div> </div>
