<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I can&apos;t walk more&apos;n a mile, Tom&#x2014;least I don&apos;t think I could.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck, but there&apos;s a mighty short cut that they don&apos;t anybody but me know about. Huck, I&apos;ll take you right to it in a skiff. I&apos;ll float the skiff down there, and I&apos;ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn&apos;t ever turn your hand over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Less start right off, Tom.&quot;</p></div> </div>
