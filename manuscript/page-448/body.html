<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I&apos;m so sorry. I won&apos;t ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live&#x2014;please make up, won&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ll thank you to keep yourself <i>to</i> yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I&apos;ll never speak to you again.&quot;</p><p> She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say &quot;Who cares, Miss Smarty?&quot; until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. </p></div> </div>
