<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Huck, I didn&apos;t wait to look around. I didn&apos;t see the box, I didn&apos;t see the cross. I didn&apos;t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don&apos;t you see, now, what&apos;s the matter with that ha&apos;nted room?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, it&apos;s ha&apos;nted with whiskey! Maybe <i>all</i> the Temperance Taverns have got a ha&apos;nted room, hey, Huck?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, I reckon maybe that&apos;s so. Who&apos;d &apos;a&apos; thought such a thing? But say, Tom, now&apos;s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe&apos;s drunk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is, that! You try it!&quot;</p><p>Huck shuddered.</p><p>&quot;Well, no&#x2014;I reckon not.&quot;</p></div> </div>
