This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now. <p>Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:</p><p>"'Tain't a Spaniard—it's Injun Joe!"</p><p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:</p><p>"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether."</p><p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood.</p></div> </div>
