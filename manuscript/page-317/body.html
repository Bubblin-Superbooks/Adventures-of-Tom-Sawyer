Well, they&apos;d just die to be here&#x2014;hey, Hucky!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I reckon so,&quot; said Huckleberry; &quot;anyways, I&apos;m suited. I don&apos;t want nothing better&apos;n this. I don&apos;t ever get enough to eat, gen&apos;ally&#x2014;and here they can&apos;t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s just the life for me,&quot; said Tom. &quot;You don&apos;t have to get up, mornings, and you don&apos;t have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame foolishness. You see a pirate don&apos;t have to do <i>anything</i>, Joe, when he&apos;s ashore, but a hermit <i>he</i> has to be praying considerable, and then he don&apos;t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.&quot;</p></div> </div>
