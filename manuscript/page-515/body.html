They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.</p><p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined by Potter&apos;s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.

We rest our case here.&quot;</p></div> </div>
