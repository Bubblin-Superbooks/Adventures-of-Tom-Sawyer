<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:</p><p> &quot;Well, I don&apos;t say it wasn&apos;t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering &apos;most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn&apos;t dead, but only run off.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yes, you could have done that, Tom,&quot; said Mary; &quot;and I believe you would if you had thought of it.&quot;</p></div> </div>
