<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&quot;Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain&apos;t a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there&apos;s a spunk-water stump, and just as it&apos;s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:</p><p>&apos;Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,&apos;</p><p>and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm&apos;s busted.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain&apos;t the way Bob Tanner done.&quot;</p></div> </div>
