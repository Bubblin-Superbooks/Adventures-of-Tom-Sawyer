<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"</p><p>"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that's mostly the way."</p><p>"And kill them?"</p><p>"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom."</p><p>"What's a ransom?"</p><p>"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. </p><p> You shut up the women, but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers—you'll see that in any book. </p></div> </div>
